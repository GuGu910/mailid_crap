# mailid_grap

	    The python script which is running on selenium will open the chrome browser (both google and yahoo) 
	    and will search the content by the string `(Ex. "domain" email)` and grab the whole <html>  content 
	    as string. Finally it will process the whole string content and matches only mail ID's.
